In the sagas of old, hunters carved their names in glory by felling beasts marked by fate. With a Bounty Ledger in hand, you too may chase such legends.


Purchase a Bounty Ledger to track and hunt a rare creature.

- A <color=yellow>map pin</color> will reveal the beast’s location.
- Steel yourself for a <color=yellow>perilous battle</color>.
- Rewards are earned only if you land the <color=yellow>final blow</color> with your own strength.

If the quarry escapes your ledger cost will be refunded.

- Bounty ledgers unlock once you have slain the creature at least once.
- After victory, return to the Almanac to claim your prize!
- If a cooldown is set, you must wait before pursuing another bounty.
