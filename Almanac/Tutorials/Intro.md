Welcome to Rusty’s Almanac, a tome of knowledge forged for those who tread the wilds of Valheim.

Within these runes lie the names of every item, piece, and creature that walks this realm, recorded so no secret is lost to wandering souls.

With this lore at your side, you may chart the unknown and face the trials of the world with wisdom in hand.

Yet the Almanac is more than record-keeping—it is a hall of deeds. Through sagas of achievement and the clash of rivals upon the leaderboard, each warrior may carve their own legend.
