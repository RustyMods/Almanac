# Almanac
Information tool that modifies the in-game trophy panel.
### Features
- Creature health, faction, damage modifiers
- Creature attacks
- Creature intelligence
- Creature taming items
- Items that are not known by players, are blacked out
### How to use
```
Simply open up the trophy panel using the in-game trophy button
Icons have been modified to become buttons.
Almanac generates file first time user clicks on a icon.
If the data is missing, try regenerating almanac
If it still is missing, it probably does not have any creature associated with the trophy.
```
### Configurations
```
Users are able to configure the damage modifiers colors using the cfg file.
